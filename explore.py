# # What information we can get from photos of businesses?
#
# Working with raw image data is infeasible, not only because its total approximate size is `200k*400*400*3 ≈ 100GB`.
#
# Also, direct pixel values are not very useful as features as photos of same objects can be quite far away in RGB space.
#
# So, let us use deep features.
#
# Following [CNN features are also great at unsupervised classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01700) that demonstrates that combination of Xception architecture and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering gives the best clustering results (using Normalized Mutual Information score) let us start with these.
#
# The implementation of Xception trained on ImageNet is available at https://github.com/Cadene/pretrained-models.pytorch.
